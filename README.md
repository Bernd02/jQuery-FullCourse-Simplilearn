## Notes

- Tutorial for jQuery
- Implementing the basics

I realized the jQuery library is a widely used library and there are numerous open-source subsets of it. Additionally, jQuery is implemented by default in the ASP.NET MVC project template. Therefore, I believe it would be beneficial to learn some basic jQuery implementation in preparation for future projects.
